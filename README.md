# DP-algorithm

This is a dynamic programming algorithm for that I developed for my PhD thesis. It's meant to solve certain agent-based models in economics for which conventional DP-methods are not suitable.

You can specify the utility and discount functions, the number of time periods, the degree of randomness in the dynamics of the state variable, and many other things.
